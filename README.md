# Lab2-Configuring-Controls
 Conducted several types of security controls, including preventive, detective, directive, and corrective.
Overview
This lab is part of my work on improving security controls and understanding how they apply within a corporate network, particularly focusing on Structureality Inc. As a cybersecurity analyst in training, my goal is to identify vulnerabilities in the network and recommend measures to mitigate potential threats. I will work with different types of security controls, testing, configuring, and gaining hands-on experience in how they function in real-world scenarios.

Scenario
In this scenario, I'm tasked with securing Structureality Inc.'s internal network, identifying any weaknesses, and implementing necessary security controls. Using my CompTIA CySA+ knowledge, I will operate from a Windows Server 2019 VM (PC10) located on the company's server subnet, and my objective is to evaluate and reinforce the security of the systems.

Objectives
This lab is designed to help me:

Understand system and network architecture in security operations (aligned with CompTIA CySA+ Objective 1.1).
Learn about vulnerability management, response, and handling (aligned with CompTIA CySA+ Objective 2.5).
Tasks
Configure Security Controls: I'll explore and configure various types of security controls, including preventive, detective, directive, and corrective measures, ensuring they effectively address the network's security needs.

Test Security Measures: I will test the effectiveness of these controls and assess how well they mitigate risks. Based on my findings, I’ll make recommendations for improvements.

Analyze Network and System Architecture: By working within the internal network, I’ll gain insight into how network and system architecture impact security operations and influence control effectiveness.

Manage Vulnerabilities: Throughout the lab, I'll identify vulnerabilities, learn how to respond to them, and manage them using appropriate tools and methods, with a focus on real-world security practices.

Environment
I will be using:

Windows Server 2019 (PC10): The virtual machine where I’ll perform configurations, run tests, and carry out investigations.
Structureality Inc. Internal Network: The network infrastructure that I am tasked with analyzing and securing.
Lab Components
Preventive Controls: I'll focus on implementing controls that prevent unauthorized access, such as configuring firewalls or setting up access control measures.

Detective Controls: I'll set up systems that detect potential threats or intrusions, helping to identify vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.

Directive and Corrective Controls: These controls will be put in place to guide appropriate responses to security issues and to correct vulnerabilities that could lead to future problems.

Conclusion
This lab will help me develop practical skills in securing a corporate network, working with security controls, and managing vulnerabilities as part of my journey toward becoming a cybersecurity analyst.
